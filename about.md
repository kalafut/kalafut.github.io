My name is Jim and I've liked technology for as long as I can remember. I've had hobbies and formal
education in electronics, but software is my real passion and I've been working with it for a long time.
There once was a time when I *pored* over QuickBasic manuals (back when manuals had heft), wrote BBS tools
and watched the x86 platform evolve. Today I follow and participate in open source software, mainly in the
area of web technologies.


 Welcome to the latest incarnation of my online hub. I can be contacted in the usual places (see navbar), or
 via good ol' [email](mailto:jim@kalafut.net).
