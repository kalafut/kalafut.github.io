I've just re-enabled my Netflix DVD service for the umpteenth time. Streaming is usually
enabled (though it's of dubious usefulness), and whether I'm getting DVDs is a matter of how
much time I'm spending on movies at all.

As a general rule, DVDs are the only way for me to watch the movies I want. I use various movie
recommendation sources and my wishlist is filled with things that are not available on streaming
services, at least not Netflix nor Amazon. As for torrents... They're usually left for the odd case where
I can't buy, rent or stream the movie anywhere. I have a job and I don't mind paying for stuff.

How bad is the streaming situation? I recently was searching Netflix for some of my top
recommendations from [Criticker](http://criticker.com) and went through nearly 20 movies before
coming across one that wasn't DVD-only. Looking for a Bogart film to stream? Netflix has you
covered, with films involving Andrea, Dominic *and* Keith Bogart!

But this is not a big deal. DVDs are just fine. The iconic Netflix envelopes are occasionally
mocked as some vestige of a media age gone by, but I don't buy into that. There is convenience
with streaming, but it's marginal. I can wait a day for a movie, and if there are multiple DVDs
in the house then there will usually be no waiting ever. I'll even say there is an advantage
to the DVD queue system: it reduces choice. Not of what to watch ever (something it increases
about 10x for Netflix), but for right *now*. My viewing time is limited, and I just as soon know
that movies A, B and C are options tonight and that's it. Surfing around a list of mediocre choices
the Netflix thinks I might like in wholly unappealing.

If streaming suddenly had the full library of movies, there would be no point for the DVDs. But
for now, in this weird state of media transition, I'm quite happy for the USPS to provide a steady
*DVD* stream to my house, allowing me to watch almost anything I want.
