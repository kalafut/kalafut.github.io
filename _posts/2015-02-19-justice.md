Federal Judge Paul Cassell, on administering a mandatory minimum sentence
to a 24 year old for three marijuana sales: 

*“If he had been an aircraft hijacker, he would have gotten 24 years in prison.
If he’s been a terrorist, he would have gotten 20 years in prison. If he was a
child rapist, he would have gotten 11 years in prison. And now I’m supposed to
give him a 55-year sentence? I mean, that’s just not right.”*
