title: "Have a Nexus 7? Get the Chrome Beta"

The Chrome browser on Nexus 7 has never had the *Close All Tabs* function like its brother on the phone. This made no sense, was annoying, and [dragged on forever](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=268157). Fortunately, the end is near. You can now download Chrome version 40 via the Chrome Beta app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrome.beta).

*Close All Tabs* is accessed by long-pressing the usual tab close X.
