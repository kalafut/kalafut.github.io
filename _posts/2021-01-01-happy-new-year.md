Welcome to 2022!

A long-ish holiday break and the start of a new year always has me thinking about my current setups. Hardware, software, schedule, habits, obligations, etc. Today I'm thinking a bit about the productivity tools I use and how well they're working for me. Let's run through them.

This a pretty boring category because it is pretty well constrained, and working well.

* [Fastmail](https://fastmail.com) has been working great for many year for personal email and I have not reason to change
* Gmail Calendar hangs around.
