I've been aware of and have occasionally used [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/index.html) since it came out 15 years ago. Some folks are put off by the bare/crude design, but I never cared too much about that. What _did_ put me off was the enormous number of settings, and frustration with it wanting to delay cards to far into the future. But really, I was just lazy to learn the program, which is why I gave up so many times.

Fast forward to 2021 and I found an entirely new use for it: reading drills for the kids. This time around I actually read about the scheduling algorithm and settings, and made a few tweaks to better suit a child just learning to read. It has been working **great**. Each kid has their own decks, and we've been tuning the amount of new materially per day to a level that is both productive but not overwhelming. The highlights:

* There is a definite "done" point each day. The screen says "Congratulations!" and we're done drilling.
* The kids get into the metrics. They know well what new/learning/review cards are, and understand how the ones they struggle within keep coming back.
* They get into the choice of whether something they got right was "hard", "good" or "easy".
* They like the stats and graphs.

Now **I** have a renewed interest in Anki for my own learning.
