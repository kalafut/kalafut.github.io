After a couple hours of fun messing with [ansible](http://www.ansibleworks.com/) and [node](http://nodejs.org/) deployments, I
think the rest of Friday night would be better spent watching 
[Grave of the Fireflies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_of_the_Fireflies).

According to [reviews](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095327/reviews?ref_=tt_ov_rt), I should
be a wreck in 90 minutes.

**Update:** yeah, it was depressing.
