I want to move this thing to Github, so say hello to [Jekyll][jekyll]. I'm not going
to bother waiting for things to settle into their final form before pushing it, so
enjoy a bunch of boilerplate Jekyll look, free, and content for a bit. It will at
least provide a modicum of incentive to wrap up the migration.

[KÃ¶nigspress][kp], we hardly knew ya.
