title: Ringing in the new year with WWV
---

A couple of years ago I published a [WWV simulator](/2019/02/12/wwv-simulator.html). On average is gets about 40 hits a day. I only occasionally review the traffic stats, but did so tonight and noticed an interesting pattern over the past week:

The the two taller spikes concide nicely with New Years even in UTC (left peak), and then a few hour later with the US East coast (right peak). I like the idea that a few folks decided to use my weekend (well, may weekends) project to ring in the new year. ðŸŽ‰
