I've been thinking quite a bit about writing a todo application. Over the years I've used tons of them (who hasn't), and I've formed my opinions about features, behaviors, appearances and architectures for this class of application. Now I want to roll my own.

This is supposed to be a fun project that will hopefully be a useful project. Because it's by me, for me, and controlled by me, I have thought about how much time will be spent tweaking the system instead of letting the system help me get stuff done. I'm not worried about that though, because I'm **always** going to tweaking whatever system I'm using at the time--no question. My hope is that my time is better spent improving a *product* of my own, rather that using that time evaluating others' work and coming up with schemes to plug things together, move data to and fro, and otherwise smooth things out. It's a chance to explore new technology, try out UI patterns for real (by using them daily), and hopefully build a thing that is, above all, something I'm happy with.

More to come on this topic.
