title: Monitoring Go apps with Distributed Tracing and OpenTelemetry
---

*I'm a happy user of [Bun](https://bun.uptrace.dev/) and like the work being done at Uptrace. The following is a guest post
by them about their monitoring projects. Enjoy!*


## What is tracing?

[Distributed tracing](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/distributed-tracing.html) allows to
observe requests as they propagate through distributed systems, especially those built using a
microservices architecture.

Tracing provides insights into your app performance along with any errors and logs. You immediately
see what conditions cause errors and how particular error affects app performance.

Using tracing, you can break down requests into
[spans](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/distributed-tracing.html#spans). **Span** is an
operation (unit of work) your app performs handling a request, for example, a database query or a
network call.

**Trace** is a tree of spans that shows the path that a request makes through an app. Root span is
the first span in a trace.

To learn more about tracing, see
[Distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/distributed-tracing.html).

## What is OpenTelemetry?

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/) is an open-source observability framework for
[distributed tracing](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/distributed-tracing.html) (including
logs and errors) and [metrics](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/metrics.html).

Otel allows developers to collect and export telemetry data in a vendor agnostic way. With
OpenTelemetry, you can [instrument](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/instrumentations/) your
application once and then add or change vendors without changing the instrumentation, for example,
here is a list [popular DataDog alternatives](https://get.uptrace.dev/compare/datadog-competitors.html) that support
OpenTelemetry.

OpenTelemetry is available for most programming languages and provides interoperability across
different languages and environments.

## How to use OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry is available for most programming languages and provides interoperability across
different languages and environments.

You can [get started with OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/) by following these 5
steps:

- **Step 1**. Install a
  [distributed tracing tool](https://get.uptrace.dev/compare/distributed-tracing-tools.html).

- **Step 2**. Browse
  [OpenTelemetry instrumentations](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/instrumentations/) to find
  examples for your framework and libraries.

- **Step 3**. [Configure](https://docs.uptrace.dev/#getting-started) OpenTelemetry SDK to export
  telemetry data to the tracing tool.

- **Step 4**. Learn about
  [OpenTelemetry Tracing API](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/distributed-tracing.html#what-s-next)
  for your programming language to create custom instrumentations.

- **Step 5**. Install
  [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/collector.html) to gather
  [infrastructure metrics](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/collector.html#host-metrics).

## OpenTelemetry Go API

You can create spans using
[OpenTelemetry Go API](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/go-tracing.html) like this:

```go
import "go.opentelemetry.io/otel"

var tracer = otel.Tracer("app_or_package_name")

func someFunc(ctx context.Context) error {
	ctx, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "some-func")
	defer span.End()

    // the code you are measuring

	return nil
}
```

You can also record
[attributes](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/distributed-tracing.html#attributes) and
errors:

```go
func someFunc(ctx context.Context) error {
	ctx, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "some-func")
	defer span.End()

	if span.IsRecording() {
		span.SetAttributes(
			attribute.Int64("enduser.id", userID),
			attribute.String("enduser.email", userEmail),
		)
	}

	if err := someOtherFunc(ctx); err != nil {
		span.RecordError(err)
		span.SetStatus(codes.Error, err.Error())
	}

	return nil
}
```

## What is Uptrace?

[Uptrace](https://github.com/uptrace/uptrace) is an open source
[DataDog alternative](https://get.uptrace.dev/compare/datadog-competitors.html) powered by OpenTelemetry and ClickHouse. It
allows you to identify and fix bugs in production faster knowing what conditions lead to which
errors.

Uptrace accepts data from OpenTelemetry and stores it in a ClickHouse database. ClickHouse is a
columnar database that is much more efficient for traces and logs than, for example, Elastic Search.
On the same hardware, ClickHouse can store 10x more traces and, at the same time, provide much
better performance.

You can [install Uptrace](https://get.uptrace.dev/guide/opentelemetry-tracing-tool.html) by downloading a DEB/RPM package
or a pre-compiled binary.
