I run an online family tree covering the Kalafut, Walker, Yeap and Tan families, **and any in-law relationships**. The site is not open to the public, but anyone in the extended family may  [request an account](https://tree.kalafut.net/index.php?route=%2Fregister%2Fkalafut). You can also [email me](mailto:jim@kalafut.net?subject=Kalafut%20family%20tree%20account%20request) or get in touch via WhatsApp, Facebook, etc. Be sure to let me know who you are when signing up!

So far the tree has a few hundred people, but even in those records there is a a lot of missing data. Iâ€™m appreciative of any information you have, especially about *your* family. If this is interesting to you, please do reach out or just request an account. If you want to learn more about the project and what the site can do, check out the [Project Guide](/tree-project-guide).

Thanks!

Jim
